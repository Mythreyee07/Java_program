## Q2_arr

  Hitler decided to declare war on Americans so he decided to build a gun on their own.These guns consist of N pieces of Steel
 ofdifferent length. These must be joined in order to create the gun. The cost to connect two pieces is equal to some of their
 lengths.To help Hitler write a program that can calculate the lowest possible cost to build the Gun.

## Q3_arr

 Mr.john is doing a transport business. As he had a lot of customers for registering the car, he wants to give the preference for the
 person who comes rst, if the car is lled with n number after that who comes with EVEN is added and the rst element is removed
, if ODD means do nothing.
 Input Format
 The rst line of input denotes seats N available in the car
 The next line of input contains total number of registered members M, followed by M space -separated integers
 Output Format
 Print the members in the car separated by a space
 If M<= 1 and N<=1 , Print -1.

 OUTPUT
 11
 Explantion: 11,110,111,112....119

## Q5

 Write a program to convert the given seconds to day, hours, minutes and seconds
 format
 Input should be integer type
 Scenario 1:
 Input : 1321856
 Output: Day : 15, HOURS:7, Mins:10, Sec:56
 Scenario 2:
 Input: 21856
 Output: Hours: 6, Min: 4, Sec: 16


# Number

## Q1_num

 Consider the following series: 1,1,2,3,4,9,8,27,16,81,32,243,64,729,128,2187â€¦
 This series is a mixture of 2 series - all the odd terms in this series form a geometric series and all the even terms form yet another
 geometric series. Write a program to nd the Nth term in the series.
 The value N is a positive integer that should be read from STDIN. The Nth term that is calculated by the program should be written
 to STDOUT. Other than the value of the nth term, no other character/string or message should be written to STDOUT. For example, if
 N=16, the 16th term in the series is 2187, so only value 2187 should be printed to STDOUT.
 You can assume that N will not exceed 30.
 Sample Input Sample Output
 11          32

## Q2_num

 Consider the following series: 0,0,2,1,4,2,6,3,8,4,10,5,12,6,14,7,16,8
 This series is a mixture of 2 series all the odd terms in this series form even numbers in ascending order and every even term is
 derived from the previous term using the formula (x/2).
 Write a program to nd the nth term in this series.
 The value n is a positive integer that should be read from STDIN the nth term that is calculated by the program should be written to
 STDOUT. Other than the value of the nth term no other characters /strings or message should be written to STDOUT.
 For example, if n=10, the 10 th term in the series is to be derived from the 9th term in the series. The 9th term is 8 so the 10th term
 is (8/2)=4. Only the value 4 should be printed to STDOUT.
 You can assume that the 'n' will not exceed 20,000.

# String

## Q1_str

  Count the occurance of the character.
  input=>AAABBCAADD
  output=>3A 2B 1C 2A 2D

## Q2_str

 Edit the difference between the two string(how many char must be changed to convert string1 to string2)
 input=> String1 = kitten String2 = Sitting
 output=> 3 (k,e,g).

## Q3_str

 Design a palindromic word from the given string by inserting the fewest number of new characters (that is already present) in the string at required
 positions.
 For example, 
 Input: race
 Output: ecarace
 Sample Input        Sample Output
 race                  ecarace
